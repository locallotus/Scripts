# Static Routes
Why you need to add Static routes or Manual routes, because that the traffic must not pass through the default gateway. We need to add Static routes to pass traffic from best way to reach the destination.
# ADD a static route
sudo ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 via 192.168.0.1 dev eth0
sudo route add -net 192.168.2.0 gw 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth1
# DELETE a static route
sudo ip route del 10.0.0.0/24
sudo route del -net 192.168.2.0 gw 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth1
# show routes
route
sudo ip route show

# remove all addresses from interface
sudo ip addr flush dev eth0
# remove an ip from interface
sudo ip addr del <ip>/<mask_bits> dev eth0

# make persistent changes, the above does not save the changes for system restart
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
iface wlan0 inet static
address 10.0.0.11
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 10.0.0.2
dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8

# for persistent static routes
Open the file /etc/network/interfaces and at the end add the persistence Static routes. IP Addresses may differ in your environment.
sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
Add the following:
#########{Static Route}###########
up ip route add 10.10.20.0/24 via 192.168.50.100 dev eth0

# configure dns servers
sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf
Modify or enter nameservers as follows:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
To test:
host google.com
dig google.com
ping google.com
nslookup google.com

# alternative dns config
Unless your ICS gateway can also perform DNS, you must manually configure the client with your ISP DNS servers. 
If you do not know your ISP's DNS servers, you can use OpenDNS servers instead.
Backup your current /etc/resolve.conf file:
sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.backup
Open /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf with your favorite text editor:
sudo vim /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
Search for the line that starts "prepend domain-name-servers", and change it to look like this:
prepend domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4;

# restart networking
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
