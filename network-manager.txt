# All the connection configuration files will be stored here:
/etc/NetworkManager
/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections

# Issues
If it is not managing your network connections, you'll need to comment out the references to all interfaces (except lo) in /etc/network/interfaces to let Network Manager handle them.
sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.bak
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

It should look similar to this when you are done:
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# This is a list of hotpluggable network interfaces.
# They will be activated automatically by the hotplug subsystem.
# auto eth1

# iface eth1 inet dhcp

Then reboot and you should be good to go!
