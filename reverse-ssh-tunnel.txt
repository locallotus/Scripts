ssh -f -N -R 10000:localhost:22 user@server
- Set port 10000 on remote server and map it to port 22 on this local machine

-N
Do not execute a remote command, useful for just forwarding

-f
Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution. Useful if ssh is going to ask for 
passwords or passphrases but you don't want the user to see it

-R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
Specifies that the given port on the remote server/host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side. Port 10000 on remote machine will map back to port 22 on the local machine

ssh -f -N -R 10001:10.0.2.3:445 user@server
- Set port 10001 on remote server to ip address port 445

ssh -f -N -R 10001:10.0.2.3:455 -R 10000:localhost:22 user@server
- Note you can also chain the -R command

SSH reverse tunnel on Windows using plink

C:\>plink -P 22 -l username -pw password -C -R 5900:127.0.0.1:5900

-P # ssh server port
-l # ssh login name
-pw # ssh server password
-C # enable compression
-R # forward remote port to local address
